## Project Milestones And Udacity Rubrick
 - [ ] Convert to typescript components in the angular 1.5.7 library
 - [ ] Responsiveness - App is equally functional on mobile and desktop, using responsive design to ensure its displayed in a useable state.
 - [ ] Accessibility: Images - All content-related images include appropriate alternate text.
 - [x] Accessibility: Focus - Focus is appropriately managed allowing users to noticeably tab through each of the important elements of the page. Modal or interstitial windows appropriately lock focus.
 - [ ] Accessibility: Elements - Elements on the page use the appropriate semantic elements. For those elements in which a semantic element is not available, appropriate ARIA roles are defined.
 - [ ] Accessibility: Design - Color selections and contrast are made with accessibility in mind.
 - [x] App Delivery: Build Process - App includes a build process (such as Grunt or Gulp). Assets are minimized and concatenated as appropriate.
